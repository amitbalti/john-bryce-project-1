# JohnBryce 1st Project

---

## About the project:

This project is like a task board.

- The user can add task using the form at the top, which will be added with the user task description, the destination date of the task, and the task time destination.
- The user can add the task, it will be added as a post sticker to the task board, and will be added to the local storage.
- After the user press the 'Add Task' button, the task will be added below the form as a post stick.
- Inside the post stick, the task description will be shown (if the task description is long, the user can roll up/down/left/right to see the entire task description).
- Below the task description the date deadline and time will be shown in the post stick.
- Finally, the user can also delete his post stick (task) - it will also be deleted from the local storage.
